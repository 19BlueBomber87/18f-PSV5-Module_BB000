#Combines .ps1 Files to one .psm1 File
18f-PS5-Module_BB000
A function that Combines every script I have written into one .psm1 File.
I have written over a dozen scripts. 
I wrapped every script in a function. 
I combined all the functions scripts into one .psm1 file
Then Importing the new .ps1m file

I spent about 2 months writing any kind of script I could.  If it worked I was happy.  Allot my mistakes I was able to learn a lesson from and apply what I learned to the next script.  

I ended up with over a dozen scripts that I wrapped in a function.   I created a function to combine all the script .ps1 files into one big .psm1 file and then import the new .psm1 file
